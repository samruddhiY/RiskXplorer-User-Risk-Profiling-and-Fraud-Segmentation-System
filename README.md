This project is designed to identify risky or suspicious users by analyzing their behavior and transaction patterns.
I used machine learning techniques like K-Means Clustering, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), and Neural Networks to segment users and assign a dynamic risk score to each one.
The final system is deployed through a Streamlit dashboard, where users can explore data, visualize fraud clusters, filter by risk levels, and download reports.
What I used: 1.Python for scripting and ML modeling
             2.Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data handling & visualizations
             3.SOM and K-Means for user clustering
             4.Artificial Neural Network to enhance pattern detection
             5.Streamlit to build an interactive dashboard
             6.Optional: Sentiment analysis (VADER) for text-based insights
 I created this project as part of my ML Engineer prep for IDFY, focusing on fraud detection and user risk analysis. It reflects my interest in real-world AI applications that blend unsupervised learning, domain knowledge, and explainability.            
The dataset used here is a cleaned and engineered version of a publicly available Kaggle dataset.
